# modular storages - drawers

I wanted to build lots (a large wall) of modular draws, using my CNC router. 
10mm and 3mm Plywood, simple, clean. 

I wanted the ability to mix and match combinations in a 600x600 cabinet. 

This repo is that result. 

You can set the dimensions of the cabinet, (H x W x D) and the stock thickness, 
then set the other drawer parameters and this will layout the dovetailed drawer 
shapes you can then mill or laser or print.
